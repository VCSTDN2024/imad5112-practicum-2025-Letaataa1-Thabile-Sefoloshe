## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: Struggled to fix my add, for lopp {in order to store songs and detaisls}
   - **Solution**: Just work aroound whati knew
   

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.
